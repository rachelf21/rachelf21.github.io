        <span class="title_text"> Flu Symptoms </span>
        <p>Influenza (flu) can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Flu is different from a
            cold.
            Flu usually comes on suddenly. People who have flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: </p>
        <UL>
            <li>fever or feeling feverish/chills</li>
            <li>cough</li>
            <li>sore throat</li>
            <li>runny or stuffy nose</li>
            <li>muscle or body aches</li>
            <li>headaches</li>
            <li>fatigue (tiredness)</li>
            <li>some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.</li>
        </UL>
        <span class="title_text"> Prevention </span>

        <span class="title_text"> Flu Treatment </span>
        <p> If you get sick with flu, antiviral drugs may be a treatment option.</p>

            symptoms.
            People at high risk of flu complications include young children, adults 65 years of age and older, pregnant
            women, and people with certain medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease. </p>
